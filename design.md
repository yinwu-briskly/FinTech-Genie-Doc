# FinTech Genie - Design Document

## Project Overview
FinTech Genie ("The Genie") is an intelligent financial filing analysis platform that automatically compares and contrasts the latest 10-K/10-Q SEC filings of publicly traded companies with their previous filings. The system leverages Alpha Vantage API for data acquisition, AWS S3 for storage, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent change analysis. The Genie identifies, analyzes, and ranks changes based on their financial significance to help investors, analysts, and compliance teams make informed decisions.
